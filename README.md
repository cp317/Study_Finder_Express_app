# SGF_Express_App
This will be the repository for express app only, do NOT put anything that is unrelated to the app here.

# Tools required
1. You will obviously need NodeJS installed, so here is a link https://nodejs.org/en/
2. To use Express I recommend getting the Webstorm IDE which will include it, you can sign up as a student and get Webstorm for free (NOTE: You don't have to use Webstorm, it is just a suggestion)

3. You will also need MySQL. You will need to create the database yourself and the approapriate tables as the migration files are not ready yet.

4. Will need to implement firebase database instead of mysql.
